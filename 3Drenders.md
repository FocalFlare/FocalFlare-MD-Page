<img src="Cybernetic Creed with WM.png" alt="" width="60%"> This was made for RedCat's birthday prompt list. **No I didn't 100% the entire thing for obvious reasons.**

<img src="Images/Images for 'art'/3DR/1/Atmo Full Collage.png" alt="" width="60%"> I made both Byze (Flaremon's friend in which, lore-wise, the two are known as "Sky Embers") and Flaremon's iyehsuu form years ago (and also tagged Sqeaks (creator of the monster species) in a tweet I made on Twitter with the two), but I decided to come back to Flaremon's form here in 2025. However, I didn't think of coming back to Byze at the time of making this render.

<img src="Images/Images for 'art'/3DR/2/Doomsday with WM.png" alt="" width="60%"> This is actually the first render I made with Aerialod. I've already heard about it, but I never had the interest in using it until the dev, Ephtracy, pushed out an update for it, which had almost everyone (including Mrmo Tarius themselves) on social media talking about it, so much so that I wanted to try it out for myself.

<img src="Images/Images for 'art'/3DR/2/Tarantu Themis.png" alt="" width="60%"> vekks might've not inspired me to use Mirror Lab as I've been using it in the past before I knew them, but they did inspire me to make a render making use of the same trantula nebula image in Aerialod as a height map that they used for Mirror Lab.

<img src="Images/Images for 'art'/3DR/1/Never Looking Back with WM.png" alt="" width="60%"> No I'm not rebranding to FCL C0MPLEX, but I ditched DeviantArt for posting art on. **Well-needed choice considering that it's nothing but unneeded drama, AI slop, scam bots, and pigeonholing.**
