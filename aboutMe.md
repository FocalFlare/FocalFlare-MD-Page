### Introduction
What is good y'all, **itzzFocalFlare**, AKA FCL C0MPLEX, Focal/FCL, Flare, Tommy Wolfox (pseudonym), or whatever you want to call me.
For those of you who know me personally, I ask you to **please refrain from using my real/legal name as that stays private**. Again, you can call me whatever so long that it's not racist or derogatory, but do not call me by my name IRL, even if you may be a family member or a relative of mine.

### About Me

I'm Afro-Irish Native American (yes I'm  black, so excuse my word usage in some cases) living in the US, and I'm [age = current year - 2002].

I'm a cisgender guy so my pronouns are he/him. However, I won't snap at you if you don't know my gender or pronouns, so when in doubt, refer to me either by my names or they/them. My sexualities are LGBTQ+ ally and asexual. I know that might not make sense to some of yall, but I have a tweet explaining it (which is from my private Twitter account, though feel free to ask me to copy-paste the explanation here).

### What I Do

I'm an SFW multimedia content creator (no nu##ty or s#xual media), so I make almost all/any sort(s) of media under the broad SFW category in mediums such as videos, music, and art.

I have two ongoing series of media. For music, I've established a multi-genre EDM playlist network called [The PIX](https://sites.google.com/view/thepix/home?authuser=0) where I showcase within playlists some of the electronic music that I liked. There are currently these few PIX series that I have made:
* PIX All-time - The start of the collection from just **Winter Mix** and **Summer Mix** (neither of which had mixes made for them) in 2017 before they became part of the collection in 2022. This series does not follow any "schedule" as each episode is made sporadically.
* Yearly PIX - The most-active series in the collection where I compile playlists of 25 tracks that I think were the best of each year before the next year comes around.
* PIX Alliance - A collective series involving self-nominated and other-nominated electronic music. This series does not follow a yearly "schedule" as each episode is made sporadically.
* Uprise of PIX: A milestone-based series celebrating the collection turning older every 7th year from 2017.

 For videos, I have a crap ton of gaming clips that I've taken within the past years and I'm putting them in multiple different compilation videos of several different clips within a series under the name ["Random Clips I Took"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHTN9xwaE13jvWsPhwYjJERQV-AJec0_d). This series is actually split into the following:
* Random Clips I Took - The main series with a basic-ass name‚Äîwhich is also big on activity where I compile compilations of 99-100 clips. These clips are from oldest to newest per folder that I've put them in, and often have the most edits. Shortened down as an acronym to "RCIT".
* RCIT: Unedited Edition - A private series of compilations that houses any compilation involving edits for excluding parts of any clip, such as certain people talking, certain spoilers of things, or the like. This does not include copyright audio as they are always muted as a legal requirement of YouTube whenever they detect it.
* RCIT: Shorthazard Edition: A series of compilations that are much shorter than the ones in RCIT. The name "Shorthazard" comes from each compilation usually being short in total length and random in the arrangement of videos. Edits are rare in this series.
* RCIT: Top 10%: A series of "megacompilations" containing the last 10 compilations of RCIT. A megacompilation is made after every 10th compilation.

Please note that the series is on an indefinite halt on YouTube for reasons surrounding their AI age verification system. [However, I've uploaded if not every RCIT compilation to Odysee prior to this change](https://odysee.com/@itzzFocalFlare:f/Random-Clips-I-Took:9?r=QZHU6SNWfrSM2dALbEHncXqF7vR5qQL8&lid=97436e5a1e70a40fd8deff2ca00f5919b0c09896), so the series will continue from there..

### Time Zone Comparison
Don't snap at me if I'm "too early or too late" to something because it took place at a time different from mine according to my time zone:
* The start of a week in the US is every Sunday at 12:00 AM [CT] (central time)

By the way, whenever I say CT/central time, in my words, I'm referring to **central North American time** and not **central European time** (CT, not CET), so my 12:00a CT is different from whatever time it may be for you in CET. I've had some people get the two mixed up, so I'd just like to make that reminder!

Assume all times being mentioned are in CT.

# Trademarks
* `Loud = Funni`‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
* Ruining silence since 2015.
* If it's too quiet, turn it up. If it's too loud, turn it down. You have a volume knob for that.
* Less is more. Minimalism is an option.

# Disclaimers
## Regarding my Knowledge and Methods of Following Directions
1. **TL;DR: my knowledge of the subject matter *will* differ from yours as I follow through with what you're saying or asking for.**
  * I'm not sensitive, but in a similar vein with someone else, there are times where I have trouble understanding something and my response to it is different from what that something is. So if you ask me anything that requires me to read up on something and I provide an answer that's not close to what you may be asking for, or if I'm trying to follow a specific format you want me to use and it somewhat doesn't fit what you want, then please don't snap at me! I'm simply trying my best to follow through with it with both my current understanding and my little attention span for reading. I am also naive, so please refrain from coming up with extremely sorry excuses to gatekeep information away from me (such as "common sense").

2. **TL;DR, there's no gray area for me between "too much words" or "too little detail". Please tell me what you need to know and I'll try to my best effort to put it short. Again, I'm naive with things, so I'd rather have you tell me what you specifically need instead of throwing everything at you.**
  * Sometimes I may even go in-depth with things I have some knowledge about as well. I am aware that those things may be too long for people to understand, but knowing how much it bites me back taking classes with assignments that require me to either answer questions in detail that my little knowledge for that question can't do effectively or efficiently or write a 3-page or 7-page essay about something I have to write about that my little skill for that essay also can't do effectively or efficiently, I feel like it will be just as vague if I were to shorten it down.

If any of the above situations ever happens, please be patient and don't fume as I'm just as human as everyone else!
